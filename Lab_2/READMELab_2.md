I used the GitHub client to clone the repository. 
You can also use the command: git clone <HTTPS-link_to_repository>
To commit the files I used the command: git commit -m "Lab_2: 1 commit"
Hash of 1 commit: 8404659be0df08f60c7ff36553d88f801b64a72d

I used the command: git checkout -b "BranchOfLab_2". 
It allowed to create a new branch called "BranchOfLab_2" and immediately switch to it.
However, you can use the command to create a branch (without switching): git branch "NameOfBranch",
and the command to switch to it: git checkout "NameOfBranch".

Changes are not reflected, because the branches are independent of each other. 
We have essentially copied the repository files into two branches 
where we can make certain changes without worrying about our changes being propagated to master.
This is very useful when there is a complex project where tasks and parts are developed by different teams.
